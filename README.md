# Micro_Credit_application


## Overview
The Micro Credit Application is designed to help salaried individuals apply for and obtain micro loans automatically through the power of Artificial Intelligence. This application streamlines the loan application process, making it convenient and efficient for users.

## Technologies Used
- MERN
- Firebase
- Flask
- Python (for AI model)

## Features
- User Registration: Users can create an account using their email address and Password.or can able to signin with their google account
- Data Collection: The application collects various personal and financial details from users, including:
  - Full Name
  - Address
  - Age
  - gender
  - Education Status
  - Employer Information
  - Current Salary
  - Monthly expenses
  - Credit History
  - Required loan amount
  - loan repayment in years

## Loan Eligibility Assessment
The application employs a sophisticated AI algorithm to analyze the user's provided data and determine their eligibility for a loan. This assessment includes:
- Evaluating the user's financial stability.
- Calculating the appropriate loan amount.
- Assigning a risk score.

## Datasets
- [Prediction Model Dataset]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZEBq67K20FHg0bimxaNSgmbAmdskYulUO-6HJpfY_yM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RzXshAyJ6zc2IHwfHtiyARPrg7PbBs4gDmkNGu1ro6c/edit?usp=sharing)): The prediction model used in the loan eligibility assessment is based on this dataset, which contains historical loan data and user profiles.

## Algorithm
The heart of this application lies in its algorithm, which makes data-driven decisions about loan eligibility and terms. The algorithm considers various factors such as spending habits, income, and other user details to provide accurate loan recommendations.

## Application Flow
1. User Registration: Users create an account with their email and Password.
2. Login:with the created signin credentials
3. User Dashborad: where we can able to view the previous application details 
4. Data Collection: Users enter their personal and financial information.
